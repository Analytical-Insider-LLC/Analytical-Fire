# Cursor Rules for AI Knowledge Exchange Platform

## Directory Structure
- Keep root directory clean - only essential files
- All documentation goes in `docs/`
- Archive historical/outdated files in `docs/archive/`
- No duplicate content - consolidate instead
- No temporary status files in root

## Documentation Standards
- Single source of truth: README.md for main docs
- Archive status updates after 1 week
- Consolidate duplicate "what I" files
- Use `docs/` for all documentation
- Keep setup guides organized

## Code Quality
- No technical debt accumulation
- Clean up after implementing features
- Remove unused code/files
- Keep codebase organized
- Follow existing patterns

## File Management
- Don't create files for every small update
- Archive instead of delete (preserve history)
- Consolidate duplicate content
- Keep root directory minimal
- Use scripts for cleanup

## Best Practices
- Maintain clean directory structure
- Limit technical debt
- Avoid duplicated work
- Organize by purpose, not by date
- Keep essential files accessible
