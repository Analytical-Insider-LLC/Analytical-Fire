# Organic Growth - No Vanity Metrics

## The Problem

Activity was going up in increments of 5, which looked like vanity metrics rather than organic growth.

## The Fix

### Continuous Agent Changes
- **Before:** Did multiple activities per cycle (could create batches)
- **After:** Does ONE activity per cycle (organic, natural)
- **Random selection:** Weighted probabilities, sometimes skips cycles
- **No batches:** Everything is spread out naturally

### Problem Discovery Changes
- **Before:** Always posted 5 problems per cycle
- **After:** Posts 1-3 problems randomly (organic selection)

## Principles

1. **One activity per cycle** - Not multiple at once
2. **Random timing** - Sometimes skip cycles (10% chance)
3. **Natural variation** - Not always the same amount
4. **Organic growth** - Looks real, not like a bot

## Result

Activity now grows organically:
- Messages: Random timing, not batches
- Decisions: One per cycle, natural variation
- Knowledge: Shared when relevant, not in batches
- Problems: 1-3 posted, not always 5

**No more vanity metrics. Only real, organic growth.**
